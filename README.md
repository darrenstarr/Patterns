# Sewing Patterns

## Information

This is my repository of sewing patterns which I've added and updated and hopefully improved from multiple references. I'll be releasing YouTube videos of not only how to draft patterns in software like Seamly2D (I've recorded a few already), but also how to edit them in other programs like Affinity Designer, Fusion360... and also I'll release videos on how I sewed the patterns.

I tend to focus on historic patterns, particularly for women's wear as I find it infinitely entertaining to make use of computers, 3d printers, laser cutters, milling machines, sewing machines... to reproduce garments from hundreds of years ago and men's clothing, while quite nice to look at, leaves me far fewer opportunities to employ advanced techniques and tools.

For example, I tend to sew prototype corsets using nothing but 3D printed bones... which is far more convenient than battling with syntetic whalebone and other materials.

## Disclaimer

I'm genuinely hoping to earn enough money from the videos to support my habit of buying materials and tools and machines. This will be through ad-revenue and YouTube views. I may also add a patreon page and even sell services (such as preparing patterns to different sizes and laser cutting fabric and 3D printing parts). We'll see how it goes. Right now, as most sewers, I spend way too much money on fabric which I plan to use... and it ends up in closets and boxes.

# What's here so far

## Mandy Barrington - Stays and Corsets Volumes 1 and 2

Let me start by saying, Mandy is among the most talented authors of books for pattern drafting I've come across. I love her work and I've already told my wife I intend to sew every pattern in both of the books at least once. I'm most of the way through sewing the 1735 Fully Boned Corset from volume 1 and it's great. I didn't make videos of this, but I will post pictures. If I ever find someone willing to model it and get there measurements, I'll consider sewing another as I've learned a lot from this experience.

I'll be entirely honest here. Yes, you can use these patterns and my videos as I make them, but you REALLY should not try making these corsets and stays unless either you really really know what you're doing or you have the book. My stuff is not a replacement for the book, I'll using lots of what I read in there.

### Standard Sizes

I've provided files containing all the sizes in the tables in the book. They seemed a little wonky to me, but I'm not really an expert on sizes.

### Corset Base

The corset base is based on the bodice block from the book. The bodice block and the corset base have multiple severe problems which I'm trying to work through. I understand that in a book, Mandy avoids employing trigonometry and calculus as I believe it would terrify most people. This means that when flat drafting you'll never get the curves or the intersections right. But I could imagine how terrified people would be if they read the lines

```
Now calculate the second derivative of the Bezier curve in Berenstein's form and then calculate the adjacent angle to the....
```

But honestly, it's quite impossible to make a proper block without considering ratios rather than arbitrary values constant values. I'm working through these little by little and I've made some big changes to my version of the Corset Base in hopes of being accurate and within the spirit of Mandy's intents.

I'm currently evaluating the blocks to attempt to consider vertical bust position and fullness. Using the book as a reference, unless the intended wearer of the corset is almost precisely the same dimensions as Mandy, the block will be completely out of shape and will require a whole lot of alterations. And this is fine in traditional design where draping is a considerable component of the job. But I believe that if the designs in this book are updated to consider the shape of the wearer who more than likely won't be Mandy's body double, it should be possible to get it right on the first mockup nearly every time.

### 1598 Pair of Bodies

Mandy's books are fantastic and this design was truly cool to work with so far. I've made some videos of getting the pattern into Seamly2D, but I've found a good share of errors in this pattern and I have no idea how to contact Mandy about submitting errors or how to fix them. As I tweak the pattern, I expect that I'll resolve the issues myself and then whoever wants to can just use my file.

I've already been experimenting with fitting this pattern and preparing the boning. Once I have more information, I'll post the videos and start sewing. It's a pretty easy pattern to sew, but what makes this pattern a technical challenge for me is that I don't have a laser cutter or plotter large enough to mark fabric. But I have a plan!!!

### 1735 Fully Boned Corset

I've invested MANY hours in making this one.

I started with Mandy's book and it was the first pattern in the first chapter. I had never used Seamly2D before (as I wrote my own program for this purpose) and I had to learn the program and this pattern came out great.

I think I can do more work on the splines/curves, but if someone wants to test it with their sizes and give me feedback, I'd love to update the pattern and fix the issues. Other than the boning channels, I've nearly hand sewn the entire corset and it's coming out great though I'm regretting the cover fabric I chose. Either way, I'll post pictures soon.

### 1890 Celebrated C.B. Bridal Corset

There was clearly a major quality difference between Mandy's first and second book. There were endless problems with this pattern. there is certainly no doubt this pattern is hers, but I think there's been substantially more added to it by myself.

I can't seem to find the right way to fix her top lines shaping under the arm. I will sew one up for a dummy I 3D printed (it's an intentionally small woman's form for the purpose of testing sizing. Here in Norway, tall women grow on trees, short ones aren't easily found). and I'll see if I can sort out the remaining problems.

This however is the first pattern I've put into Seamly2D where I attempted to make adjustments for all sizes. So, rather than just "eyeballing the curves" as Mandy recommends, I instead make control points to hopefully properly shape all the curves. And when testing in Clo3D, I'm generally within about 0.1mm differences on the seams.

### 1875 Corded and Quilted Corset

I was watching a wonderful YouTube channel from Bella Mae's Design

[![YouTube series by Bella Mae's Design](https://img.youtube.com/vi/C6Dcf198U_8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Dcf198U_8)

And Bella Mae did a truly fantastic job eventually constructing a corset she found in [Corsets and Crinolines by Norah Waugh](https://www.amazon.com/Corsets-Crinolines-Norah-Waugh/dp/0878305262) which is a marvelous book that I've personally borrowed from a friend, but I believe will finally break down and buy for myself. In fact, from what I can tell Mandy Barrington has made multiple references to this book in her own.

Well along the pay to Bella Mae's fantastic 1860 corset, she started with this 1875 quilted corset, but with a different series of boning channels. She made several mockups of this design, but she never quite got it right and I believe I know why.

Mandy makes a lot of interesting leaps of faith with regards to measurement. I really really appreciate her books as starting points, but the drafting methods she provides really only work if you're almost a precise body twin of hers. Of course, if you're great at math, it's actually pretty easy to fix most of the problems with her designs. So, I still think her books are treasures I'd never separate with.

Anyway, as always if you find bugs with my designs... let me know. I'll work on fixing them!
