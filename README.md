# Sewing Patterns

## Information

This is my repository of sewing patterns which I've added and updated and hopefully improved from multiple references. I'll be releasing YouTube videos of not only how to draft patterns in software like Seamly2D (I've recorded a few already), but also how to edit them in other programs like Affinity Designer, Fusion360... and also I'll release videos on how I sewed the patterns.

I tend to focus on historic patterns, particularly for women's wear as I find it infinitely entertaining to make use of computers, 3d printers, laser cutters, milling machines, sewing machines... to reproduce garments from hundreds of years ago and men's clothing, while quite nice to look at, leaves me far fewer opportunities to employ advanced techniques and tools.

For example, I tend to sew prototype corsets using nothing but 3D printed bones... which is far more convenient than battling with syntetic whalebone and other materials.

## Disclaimer

I'm genuinely hoping to earn enough money from the videos to support my habit of buying materials and tools and machines. This will be through ad-revenue and YouTube views. I may also add a patreon page and even sell services (such as preparing patterns to different sizes and laser cutting fabric and 3D printing parts). We'll see how it goes. Right now, as most sewers, I spend way too much money on fabric which I plan to use... and it ends up in closets and boxes.

# What's here so far

## Mandy Barrington - Stays and Corsets Volumes 1 and 2

Let me start by saying, Mandy is among the most talented authors of books for pattern drafting I've come across. I love her work and I've already told my wife I intend to sew every pattern in both of the books at least once. I'm most of the way through sewing the 1735 Fully Boned Corset from volume 1 and it's great. I didn't make videos of this, but I will post pictures. If I ever find someone willing to model it and get there measurements, I'll consider sewing another as I've learned a lot from this experience.

### 1598 Pair of Bodies

Mandy's books are fantastic and this design was truly cool to work with so far. I've made some videos of getting the pattern into Seamly2D, but I've found a good share of errors in this pattern and I have no idea how to contact Mandy about submitting errors or how to fix them. As I tweak the pattern, I expect that I'll resolve the issues myself and then whoever wants to can just use my file.

I've already been experimenting with fitting this pattern and preparing the boning. Once I have more information, I'll post the videos and start sewing. It's a pretty easy pattern to sew, but what makes this pattern a technical challenge for me is that I don't have a laser cutter or plotter large enough to mark fabric. But I have a plan!!!

### 1735 Fully Boned Corset

I've invested MANY hours in making this one.

I started with Mandy's book and it was the first pattern in the first chapter. I had never used Seamly2D before (as I wrote my own program for this purpose) and I had to learn the program and this pattern came out great.

I think I can do more work on the splines/curves, but if someone wants to test it with their sizes and give me feedback, I'd love to update the pattern and fix the issues. Other than the boning channels, I've nearly hand sewn the entire corset and it's coming out great though I'm regretting the cover fabric I chose. Either way, I'll post pictures soon.
